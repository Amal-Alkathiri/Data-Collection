What is an API?¶
HTML, CSS and javascript create a human-readable webpages.
It is useful to implement applications that can consume the data on these webpages.
You can scrape webpages, but, it’s a tedious task!
So, APIs provide machine-readable data for these software, mainly in the form of JSON responses (we will shortly learn more about JSON files).
Companies such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr provide access to their data for software developers via their APIs
API stands for Application Programming Interfaces, many website provide their data through the API so they can control how and when their data is being used. 
How an API works?
Simply, you send requests to a remote server and the remote server respond by sending the data back to you.
Then, what we need is to:
1) Establish our connection to the server 
2) Send requests
3) Receive responses 
4) Manipulate responses

How does the API work?

APIs use the HTTP (Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol) which is based on a request-response cycle
